# [PAT: Parameter-Free Audio-Text Aligner to Boost Zero-Shot Audio Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15062)

##  Overview


**PAT** (Parameter-Free Audio-Text Aligner) is a **simple**, **training-free** method designed to **enhance zero-shot audio classification** using Audio-Language Models (ALMs), particularly those similar to CLAP. It bolsters cross-modal interactions by enriching both **textual** and **audio** representations through mutual feedback loopsâ€”without introducing new parameters or requiring additional training :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
